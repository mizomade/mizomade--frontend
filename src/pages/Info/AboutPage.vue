            </p>
            <p>
              Founded in 2019, MizoMade.com is an online Mizo web community
              where people can share articles and blogs that may enrich the
              society with new ideas and knowledges
            </p>
            <p>
              The goal is to share one's knowledge and experiences through our
              web blog community. As only a small portion of the Mizo community
              is technologically literate and as almost 60% of the Mizo
              population does not know how to use a website,the resources
              available to the people is very limited and thus this resulted in
              an unequal resouce availability. And also since many of the online
              contents are written in languages other than Mizo the language
              barrier thus has set a bigger barrier among the people to even
              learn how to work around it.
              <br />
              MizoMade.com is designed in a minimalistic and intuitive approach
              so that even non-sophisticated users may know how to utilize the
              resources in MizoMade.<br />
              The resources in Mizomade are 100% free for anyone.<br />
